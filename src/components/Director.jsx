        Industry and Institute collaborations and linkages are a must for
        sustainable growth of technology, economy, and human civilisation. NIT
        Raipur is sincerely working for symbiotic relationship with industries
        since its inception in 1956. Campus placement process is an important
        aspect of this relationship and further strengthening this relationship
        by undertaking a visit to our Institute for the campus placement of our
        students.

        NIT Raipur, established as one of the earliest engineering colleges of
        independent India, has continuously strived to achieve excellence in
        technology education and research; in the process, it has carved a niche
        for itself on the national level. On account of its academic atmosphere,
        well qualified and committed faculty members, regular extra-curricular
        activities and regular and examination procedure, the institute ensures
        the holistic development of students.

        The distinguished alumni of the institute have contributed significantly
        to various fields such as industry, academia, and administration and
        bear a testimony to the caliber of the institution. I am confident that
        a placement visit to our campus will be mutually beneficial and students
        of the institute will prove to be an asset to your organization.
      </p>
